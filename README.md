# AgentDEX: AI-Powered Decentralized Exchange

## Overview

AgentDEX is a decentralized exchange that combines traditional DEX functionality with an AI agent interface for a more intuitive trading experience. Users can interact with the protocol through both a traditional swap interface and a conversational AI agent that helps manage trades and liquidity positions.

## Features

### Core DEX Functionality

- Token swaps with automatic price calculation
- Liquidity provision and fee collection
- Intelligent forwarding to Uniswap V2 for optimal trade execution
- Support for any ERC20 token pair

### AI Agent Interface

- Natural language interaction for trades and liquidity management
- Conversational interface for managing positions
- Trade suggestions based on pool analysis
- Clear explanations of complex DeFi operations

### Technical Architecture

- Smart contract protocol built with Solidity
- Nest.js backend with GraphQL API
- React frontend with both traditional and chat interfaces
- Automated testing suite
