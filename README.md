# AgentDEX: AI-Powered Decentralized Exchange

## Overview

AgentDEX is a decentralized exchange that combines traditional DEX functionality with an AI agent interface for a more intuitive trading experience. Users can interact with the protocol through both a traditional swap interface and a conversational AI agent that helps manage trades and liquidity positions.

## Features

### Core DEX Functionality

- Token swaps with automatic price calculation
- Liquidity provision and fee collection
- Intelligent forwarding to Uniswap V2 for optimal trade execution
- Support for any ERC20 token pair

### AI Agent Interface

- Natural language interaction for trades and liquidity management
- Conversational interface for managing positions
- Trade suggestions based on pool analysis
- Clear explanations of complex DeFi operations

### Technical Architecture

- Smart contract protocol built with Solidity
- Nest.js backend with GraphQL API
- React frontend with both traditional and chat interfaces
- Automated testing suite

### Prerequisites

- Make sure to set the env variables
- Node.js >= 16
- Docker
- MetaMask or other Web3 wallet

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/All-Khwarizmi/agent-dex.git

cd agent-dex

yarn install
```

### Local Development

```bash

# Letâ€™s start the local node
yarn chain

# Compile contracts
yarn compile

# Deploy contracts
yarn deploy


# Add factory contract address to .env.local in nest package
# You can find the address in packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts (after deployment) 
# Be careful to select the right chain!
# AND
# on the frontend under /debug

# Setup database
yarn db

# Start backend
# You can either use docker
yarn backend:docker
# or run it locally
yarn backend:start

# Start frontend
yarn start

# Fund user wallet with ETH - DAI - USDC - WETH
cd packages/foundry && make fund USER_ADDRESS=xDcc4E41072017A20101B68B9500630A3ab6fE2fF # Use your own address

```

#### Test

```bash
# Contracts tests
yarn test

# Backend tests
yarn nest:test
```

## Usage

### Traditional Interface

1. Connect your wallet
2. Select tokens for swap
3. Enter amount
4. Confirm transaction

## Protocol Design

### Smart Contracts

- Factory contract for pool creation and management
- Pool contracts for individual token pairs
- Uniswap V2 integration for trade forwarding

### Events

- Pool creation/modification events
- Swap events
- Liquidity addition/removal events

## Security

### Auditing

- Built on proven DEX patterns
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Security-first development approach

### Considerations

- Price manipulation prevention
- Front-running protection
- Proper access controls
